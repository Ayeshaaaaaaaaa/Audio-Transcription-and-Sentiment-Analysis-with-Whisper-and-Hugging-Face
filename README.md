# Audio-Transcription-and-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Whisper-and-Hugging-Face
This project combines audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model and sentiment analysis using the Hugging Face distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model. It first transcribes audio files into text and then processes the transcription in chunks to analyze the sentiment of each segment.
